# Introduction to Quantum Physics
Codes for a pedagogical approach to MPS and Continuous Variable systems (CV)

#Example_Code_state_to_MPS is a very simple example how to decompose a state into a MPS. The comments should be sufficient to understand everything.

Continuous_Variable_Gates introduces some CV gates and should help to get familiar with CV system, Wigner plots, squeezing, displacement and beam splitters.
